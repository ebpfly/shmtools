### Console Output
- [x] Performance timing reported
- [x] Model training messages
- [x] Speedup calculations shown

**Differences**: 
- MATLAB focuses on density estimation visualization
- Python focuses on classification performance metrics

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None - The implementations serve different purposes appropriately

### Minor Issues (Should Fix)
1. Python uses real SHM data while MATLAB uses synthetic 2D Gaussian mixture
2. No direct density visualization in Python (only score distributions)
3. Different kernel types not explored in Python (only Gaussian)

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. Python adds classification framework not in MATLAB
2. Python includes multiple distance metrics comparison
3. Python demonstrates scalability analysis
4. Python integrates with SHM damage detection workflow

## Required Code Changes

No critical changes required. The Python implementation successfully demonstrates fast metric KDE in an SHM context, which is more practical than MATLAB's synthetic example.

Optional enhancements:
1. Add 3D density visualization for lower-dimensional examples
2. Include naive KDE comparison for timing benchmarks
3. Test additional kernel types beyond Gaussian
