    "\n",
    "This usage script focuses on extracting a number of damage features for gearbox diagnostics and compares them statistically to determine which would be a good candidate for detecting worn tooth damage of a gearbox vibrations signal. Vibration signals were collected of over a number of instances for a baseline healthy state as well as worn tooth damage state. The bearings on the main shaft used were fluid film bearings which supported the main shaft that drove the gear box. The usage script begins by loading the vibration signals and angular resampling the vibration signal to a specified samples per revolution of the gear shaft. The resampled signal is compared to the raw time signal to demonstrate the improvement of the gear mesh components. The power spectral densities are looked at to see if any visible damage has occurred between the damage state and the baseline state. The residual difference and band pass mesh signals are filtered for the angular resampled signal using fir filtering methods which are used by various gearbox damage features. Then the script plots some time frequency domain figures of merit to see if any useful information can be extracted. Of the four time frequency domains presented the continuous wavelet scalogram is chosen for further processing. The Hoelder exponent is computed from the continuous wavelet scalogram for damage detection in a later damage feature extraction method. Ten damage features are computed from the signals processed earlier on and compared using receiver operating characteristic curves to see which have better performance for the data set.\n",

    "The data in this example was retrieved from a system that had minor speed fluctuations in the main shaft speed. The shaft speed variation was on the order or +/- 3RPM. signalARSTach uses a single pulse per rotation signal to resample a time domain signal that may have large speed fluctuations into a vibration signal tracked to orders of the shaft rotation in an equally space angular domain. This improves periodic frequency components that would have smeared from shaft speed fluctuations. The tachometer is located on the main shaft but the gear box is separated by a belt drive with a gear ratio equal to 1:3.71 and must be accounted for to resample to the gearbox shaft. nFilter is used for various anti-aliasing functionality in signalARSTach. signalARSTach by default uses a Kaiser windowed fir filter with a beta shape function set to 4 as its filter type."

    "Filtering of the angular resampled signal is used to determine three traditional processed signals used in gearbox damage detection. Here the signals are filtered and plotted for comparison. The residual signal consists of the angular resampled signal with the shaft and gear mesh frequencies filtered out. To do this a narrow band fir filter is used and set to filter ate gear mesh orders with a width of an estimate of the first order sideband. The difference signal is similar to the residual signal but its band width is set to be a little larger than that of the residual signal filter to also filter out first order sidebands. The band pass gear mesh signal is the angular resampled signal with all frequency components filtered out except gear mesh harmonics and the first order sidebands."

Impulses create broad band noise and this can be seen in the high frequency range of the scalogram which directly corresponds to gear teeth impacts that are extracted using the Hoelder exponent.

As previously stated this picks up on impacts or nonlinearities in a signal that cause increases in high energy content. By looking at the frequency domain of the Hoelder exponent for a gear it is possible to track the impulses of gear teeth and as the wear the magnitude of these impulses in the Hoelder domain will begin to decay making it useful in monitoring gear teeth wear."

    "Several features are compared here. Raw signal features like crest factor kurtosis and root mean square are good at detection damage but the damage features suffer from a lack of localization in determining the cause of change. Increases in load and speed can cause a large change in the value of these features. FM0 uses the resampled signal and track the gear mesh orders which makes it tuned to the gear in question. FMH is similar to FM0 but uses the Hoelder series instead giving it improved separation in the damage features between baseline and worn tooth states. The residual and difference signals monitor changes in the frequency content other than that of gear mesh harmonics and sidebands and the band pass mesh signal features monitor the kurtosis of the enveloped signal of primarily gear mesh harmonics."
