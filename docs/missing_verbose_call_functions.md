# Functions Missing verbose_call Field

This document lists all SHMTools functions ending with `_shm` that are missing the `verbose_call` field in their docstring.

**Generated on**: 2025-08-23  
**Total functions checked**: 102  
**Functions missing verbose_call**: 11

## Summary

The following functions need to have the `verbose_call` field added to their docstring metadata:

| File | Function | Line |
|------|----------|------|
| shmtools/plotting/spectral_plots.py | plot_psd_shm | 178 |
| shmtools/plotting/spectral_plots.py | plotPSD_shm | 550 |
| shmtools/core/signal_processing.py | ars_tach_shm | 14 |
| shmtools/core/signal_processing.py | fir1_shm | 275 |
| shmtools/core/cbm_processing.py | ars_tach_shm | 15 |
| shmtools/core/signal_filtering.py | residual_signal_shm | 15 |
| shmtools/core/signal_filtering.py | difference_signal_shm | 139 |
| shmtools/core/signal_filtering.py | bandpass_condition_signal_shm | 218 |
| shmtools/core/signal_filtering.py | gear_mesh_filter_shm | 317 |
| shmtools/core/signal_filtering.py | envelope_signal_shm | 437 |
| shmtools/core/preprocessing.py | scale_min_max_shm | 154 |

## Details by Module

## Expected verbose_call Format

The `verbose_call` field should be added to each function's docstring metadata section:

```python
def function_name_shm(...):
    """
    Function description.
    
    .. meta::
        :category: Category Name
        :matlab_equivalent: matlabFunctionName
        :complexity: Basic/Intermediate/Advanced
        :data_type: Time Series/Spectral/Features/etc
        :output_type: Features/Plot/Signal/etc
        :verbose_call: function_name_shm(param1=value1, param2=value2, ...)
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    ...
    """
```

## Priority for Updates

**High Priority**: Functions in `core/` modules as they are fundamental building blocks  
**Medium Priority**: Functions in `plotting/` modules as they are used for visualization  

## Notes

- All other 91 functions already have the `verbose_call` field properly defined
- The `verbose_call` field is used by the JupyterLab extension for interactive parameter linking
- Missing this field may cause GUI functionality to not work properly for these functions

## Validation Method

This list was generated by:
1. Searching for all functions ending with `_shm` using regex pattern `def \w+_shm\(`
2. Parsing each function's AST to extract docstrings
3. Checking for presence of `verbose_call` field using various pattern matching approaches
4. Cross-referencing with manual inspection of docstring format

Functions were considered to have the field if any of these patterns were found in their docstring:
- `verbose_call:`
- `:verbose_call:`
- `.. verbose_call::`
- `verbose_call=`
