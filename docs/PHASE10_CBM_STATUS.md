# Phase 10: Condition-Based Monitoring Implementation Status

## Overview

Phase 10 involves implementing condition-based monitoring (CBM) functions for rotating machinery analysis, specifically for bearing and gear fault detection. The target example is `example_CBM_Bearing_Analysis.m` which demonstrates a sophisticated workflow for bearing fault detection using angular resampling and discrete/random separation.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED: Time Synchronous Averaging

**Function Implemented**: `time_sync_avg_shm` / `timeSyncAvg_shm`

- **Location**: `shmtools/features/condition_based_monitoring.py`
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested
- **Description**: Averages angularly resampled signals across multiple revolutions to extract periodic components and suppress random noise
- **Use Case**: Used to enhance gear mesh frequencies and reduce bearing noise in rotating machinery analysis

### ⚠️ PENDING: Angular Resampling Functions

The following functions require extensive implementation work due to complex dependencies:

#### 1. `arsTach_shm` - Angular Resampling from Tachometer
- **Complexity**: High
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `filter_shm` (digital filtering)
  - `fir1_shm` (FIR filter design)
  - `window_shm` (windowing functions)
  - Complex tachometer signal processing algorithms
- **Algorithm**: Uses tachometer pulse signals to resample time-domain signals to angular domain

#### 2. `arsAccel_shm` - Angular Resampling from Accelerometer  
- **Complexity**: Very High
- **Dependencies**:
  - All dependencies from `arsTach_shm`
  - `analyticSignal_shm` (Hilbert transform)
  - Bandpass filtering and phase extraction algorithms
- **Algorithm**: Extracts gear mesh frequencies from accelerometer signals to estimate shaft phase

#### 3. `discRandSeparation_shm` - Discrete/Random Separation
- **Complexity**: High  
- **Dependencies**:
  - Advanced windowing and FFT operations
  - Transfer function estimation
  - Non-causal filtering algorithms
- **Algorithm**: Separates periodic (gear) and random (bearing) components using frequency response estimation

## Dependency Analysis

### Missing Core Functions

The CBM functions require several preprocessing functions that are not yet implemented:

1. **`filter_shm`** - Digital filtering with MATLAB compatibility
2. **`fir1_shm`** - FIR filter design (Parks-McClellan, Kaiser windows)
3. **`window_shm`** - Windowing functions (Kaiser, Hanning, Parzen, etc.)
4. **`analyticSignal_shm`** - Hilbert transform for analytic signals

### Implementation Complexity

Each missing function represents a significant implementation effort:

- **`filter_shm`**: Requires handling different filter types, zero-phase filtering, and MATLAB-compatible delay compensation
- **`fir1_shm`**: Complex filter design algorithms with optimal coefficient calculation
- **`window_shm`**: Multiple windowing functions with exact MATLAB parameter compatibility
- **`analyticSignal_shm`**: Hilbert transform implementation with proper boundary handling

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Full Implementation (4-6 weeks)
1. Implement all missing preprocessing functions
2. Implement angular resampling functions
3. Create complete CBM bearing analysis notebook
4. **Effort**: ~40-60 hours of development time

### Option 2: Simplified Implementation (1-2 weeks)
1. Use SciPy equivalents where possible (different API but similar functionality)
2. Implement simplified versions of angular resampling
3. Create demonstration notebook with synthetic data
4. **Effort**: ~10-20 hours of development time

### Option 3: Reference Implementation (Current Status)
1. Provide `timeSyncAvg_shm` for basic TSA operations
2. Document remaining functions as future work
3. Reference original MATLAB code for complete implementation
4. **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Current Deliverables

1. **Working Function**: `time_sync_avg_shm` with comprehensive documentation
2. **Module Structure**: CBM module ready for additional functions
3. **Documentation**: Complete algorithm analysis and dependency mapping
4. **Test Coverage**: Basic functionality validated

## Conclusion

Phase 10 has been **partially completed** with the most fundamental CBM function (`timeSyncAvg_shm`) implemented and tested. The remaining angular resampling functions represent a major implementation effort that would be better addressed as a dedicated project phase focusing specifically on signal preprocessing and advanced filtering algorithms.

The implemented time synchronous averaging function provides immediate value for:
- Reducing noise in periodic machinery signals
- Extracting gear mesh components
- Preprocessing for other damage detection algorithms

This establishes a solid foundation for future CBM algorithm development while providing practical utility for current users.
